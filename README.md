# Streamlit
- Streamlit is tool to build dashboard without needing to configure the styling. The framework merges several technologies with the upside of being in python, which allows performing EDA and seeing the results on a clean an aesthetically pleasing website.

# Features.
- Several components from streamlit.
    - Map.
    - Geo scatering point.
    - Altair graphs.
    - Line charts.
    - Bar charts.
- Quick and ad hoc model deploying and inference using Scikit-learn.

# Note.
- The tone of the project focused on learning how to create dashboard using streamlit and connect several data science and machine learning components. The dataset and models were not the focus, that the reason I kept a model with 0.5 on R2.

# Second Note.
- To run everything from the dashboard, run the other scripts first
